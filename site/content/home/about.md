# Biography

[Download my abbreviated CV](http://tiny.cc/gusdunn_short_cv)

## Boston Children's Hospital

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in [Scott Snapper's](http://www.childrenshospital.org/research-and-innovation/research/labs/snapper-laboratory) Lab at BCH.
The lab studies human gastrointestinal inflammatory disorders like [Crohn's Disease](https://www.crohnsandcolitis.com/crohns) and [Ulcerative Colitis](https://www.crohnsandcolitis.com/ulcerative-colitis) through a combination of basic science and translational approaches.
I am involved in projects that leverage high throughput DNA/RNA sequencing, metagenomics, and CyTOF among other methods.
I have also had the opportunity to design and maintain various analysis pipelines for the lab.

## Yale University

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, under [Adalgisa Caccone](https://caccone.yale.edu/).
I was responsible for overseeing sample collection in the field (Uganda), next generation sequencing management and analysis of population genomics studies.
The project focused on multiple populations of tsetse flies that harbor different versions of the trypanosome parasite that cause [human African trypanosomiasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_trypanosomiasis) (sleeping sickness).

## University of California, Irvine

I did my graduate work in the lab of [Anthony James](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile.cfm?faculty_id=2154).
The lab focus is to produce [genetically modified mosquitoes](https://www.nature.com/news/gene-drive-mosquitoes-engineered-to-fight-malaria-1.18858) that do not transmit [Malaria](https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/) or [Dengue Fever](https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html) and will spread this trait swiftly through local mosquito populations.
I used bioinformatics to study gene regulation and expression at the transcriptome level in mosquitoes.
Specifically, I used RNA-seq and microarray technology to study how bloodfeeding affects gene expression in female mosquitoes and identify over-represented sequence patterns in regulatory DNA which may lead to improved regulation of transgenic anti-disease constructs.
